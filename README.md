# MedCom – Helping patients and doctors in the kidney stone journey
MedCom aims at improving the kidney stone journey by providing trustworthy information, connecting the patients and the doctors, and by helping the patients track their nutrition, water and medication intake. This is made possible through the MedCom app that provides the means to achieve this goal.
## Things used in this project:
### Software:
Figma: https://www.figma.com
### Hardware:
MacOS based solution (our solution): iPad with no further requirements
Windows based solution: tablet or computer with no further requirements
Small QR code stands: At the doctors’ offices or clinics, in order for the patients to get connected with their doctors upon scanning the QR code.
## Story:
MedCom is a software solution, developed by students of Technical University Munich during the Tech Challenge in the summer semester 2020/2021 in collaboration with Dornier MedTech company. The aim was to help solve many challenges that rise for both the healthcare professionals and patients with kidney stones along their way. MedCom provides the right solution to this challenge by addressing the main pain points. The process of creating the prototype is explained in this document.
### What is MedCom?
The main pain points that MedCom is trying to solve are, first of all, false and incomplete information that the patients get from google and the doctors have to spend some time to explain and correct this misleading information. Second, the patients are not monitored after their treatment and they usually come back to their doctors only after the recurrence of their stones. Last but not least, most of the patients do not track their nutrition and water intake and this causes the recurrence of stones for about 50% of the patients!
MedCom is an app that addresses and solves these problems by connecting the two sides (doctors and patients) and to enhance the flow of information by helping the doctors monitor their patients journey and to record this journey. As a result there would be lower loss of information when the patient decides to change his/her doctor or clinic.
 
### How does MedCom work:
The patients can install the app and create their personal profile. They can then either search for medical professionals there or to go to a doctor’s office and scan the QR code at the desk. By scanning the QR code the patient is connected to his/her doctor and the doctor can provide him/her with information necessary for the treatment journey. The patient can also benefit from tools like nutrition and water intake tracking that are personalized and tailored to the patient’s profile.
### Advantages of MedCom:
For patients: <br/>
- Less confusion when first experiencing pains. The patient can get insightful information about his condition and to get connected to the right professionals.
- No need of redoing some tests and going through first check-ups every time the patient changes his/her doctor, as the information is recorded in the app by the previous doctors.
- They can track their nutrition, their water intake and their medications, and as a result, have a lower chance of the recurrence of their stones.

For doctors: <br/>
- The doctors don’t need to spend too much time on just explaining basic information to the patient and to correct the wrong information they got on the internet, as they can provide all the useful information in the app and the patient can go through them while sitting in the waiting room.
- In the case of patients changing their urologist or being referred to a new doctor, the doctors and clinics don’t need to spend time and resources on basic tests and checkups when they have these new patients, because the previous results were recorded in the app.
 
## Prototype:
### Preparation:
In order to visualize how the MedCom app works, a prototype was built in Figma. The prototype is accessible through the link below:
